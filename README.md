# Pet project for Automation testing of AgileS
## Stack: Pytest + Selenium
### Done:

 - **users_creator.py**: Automatic users creation by parsing users.xlsx file with user data
and executing required steps in browser. Can create any amount of users. Password for any user: Godfather1989!
(at the moment, some issues with app when input pass)
